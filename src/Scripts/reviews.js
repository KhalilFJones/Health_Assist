Once the appointment is submitted, an Ajax request is made to our server, which processes the phone number and appointment details. The server then interacts with an SMS gateway to dispatch the confirmation message to the user’s phone, ensuring they receive immediate confirmation of their appointment. \n\nNewsletter Subscription Confirmation via Email:\n How It Works: Upon subscribing to our newsletter, Ajax plays a crucial role in sending a confirmation email to the user. When the user submits their email address through our subscription form, an Ajax request is sent to our server with the user’s details. The server processes the request and triggers an email to be sent via our email service provider. This confirmation email verifies the user’s subscription and provides them with relevant information about the newsletter."
